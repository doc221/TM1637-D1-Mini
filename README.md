# TM1637 with Wemos D1 Mini and optionaly BME280
Simple project that connects a Wemos D1 mini to a TM1637 4-digit 7 segment LED display.
Added yaml ESPHome code for integration with Home Assistant.
The BME280 is optional, the 4 pins can be used to your liking, you need to change the yaml code yourself to get that to work.
The ZIP files contains the KiCad schematics en PCB board files.

All comments are welcome!

Enjoy.
